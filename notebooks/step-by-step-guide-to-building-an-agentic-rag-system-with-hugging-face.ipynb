        "In this comprehensive tutorial, you will learn how to construct an Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using Hugging Face's smolagents library. This guide will walk you through the process of creating a system that autonomously retrieves and generates information, significantly enhancing the performance of AI in practical applications. By leveraging the power of autonomous agents and RAG, you can improve the efficiency and accuracy of AI models, making them more effective in real-world scenarios. This tutorial is designed to equip you with the practical skills needed to build and deploy scalable, secure, and production-ready AI solutions.\n\n## System Architecture Breakdown\n\nThe architecture of our RAG system integrates several components to form a cohesive whole. At its core, the system consists of:\n\n- **Retrieval Tools**: These are responsible for fetching relevant data from a knowledge base.\n- **Language Models**: Large language models process the retrieved data to generate coherent responses.\n- **Agentic Layer**: This layer coordinates the retrieval and generation processes, ensuring seamless interaction between components.\n\nThe diagram above illustrates how these components interact. The retrieval tools interface with large language models, enabling efficient knowledge extraction and response generation. This architecture is designed to address production constraints by ensuring scalability and security.\n\n## Step-by-Step Implementation with Code Snippets\n\n### Setting Up the Environment\n\nFirst, ensure your environment is ready.
